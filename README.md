# Cattle eQTL results


We identified expression quantitative trait loci(eQTL) in subcutaneous adipose(N=116), liver(N=120), and longissimus dorsi muscle(N=120) from 120 Simmental cattle. Genes were selected based on expression thresholds of ≥0.1 TPM in ≥20% of samples, and expression values for each gene were inverse normal transformed across samples. We used age ,batch 2 genotyoe PCs and 5 PEER as covariates. fastQTL were applied to identify cis-eQTLs.

Here is the cis-eQTL results for three tissues.
